    "bio": "\nNow in his sixth term as Councillor,\u00a0Michael Thompson is widely regarded as one of Toronto\u2019s hardest working and most effective political leaders.\nUnder the banner of \u201cgetting things done,\u201d Michael is known to his constituents as a community builder committed to bringing people together in a spirit of collaboration. He has led the formation of local community associations, youth leadership initiatives and Business Improvement Areas. To engage residents in his ward, he holds regular public meetings and annually resolves hundreds of local and city-wide issues.\nIn addition to a strong focus on serving his constituents, Michael\u2019s commitment to developing Toronto\u2019s economy is longstanding. He regularly draws upon his widespread network of business relationships to help the city to enhance business retention, promote economic growth, advance equity and increase private-sector employment. As former Chair of the city\u2019s Economic and Community Development Committee, he convened an advisory group of leaders in business, labour, academia and the not-for-profit sectors to advise the city on its economic development strategies and priorities. The group\u2019s Collaborating For Competitiveness\u00a0 recommendations were adopted in full by the city and incorporated into the city\u2019s operations. Locally, he spearheaded the creation of the Wexford Heights Business Improvement Area and established a Job Fair that each year brought thousands of job seekers together with dozens of employers.\nHis active engagement with business has helped speed the launch of new business ventures, resolved business/residential conflicts and gained business participation in a wide range of community-building initiatives. In recent years, the international connections he has developed and nurtured have played a significant role in securing billions of dollars in new investment for the city, attracting major international conferences, growing city-wide employment and contributing to a more robust economy.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit the city in 2020, Michael stepped to the forefront to educate, motivate and support city residents as they coped with unprecedented challenges. He held frequent virtual town hall meetings to ensure that residents had the best and latest expert information. Seeing pandemic recovery as an opportunity to redress previous equity failures, he convened a panel of diverse and creative leaders to ensure that the city\u2019s recovery did not leave chronically disadvantaged groups behind. The recommendations in the group\u2019s report, Building Back Stronger, were adopted by the city and incorporated into its recovery strategy.\nMichael is a firm believer in the critical value of culture as a builder of strong communities and a major contributor to Toronto\u2019s economy. When he first took office, he co-founded the Taste of Lawrence Festival, which brings together tens of thousands of people each year to experience local cuisine and performing arts. In 2013, he led the city\u2019s efforts to create a new arts and culture plan that provided a bold roadmap for cultural vitality, strengthened arts spending and launched a new era of collaboration among arts and culture groups across the city. Michael spearheaded the creation of Toronto\u2019s Music Office and served as the first Chair of the city\u2019s Music Advisory Committee. He also played a key role in efforts to attract international film and television productions, and studio investments to Toronto.\nThroughout his years on Council, Michael\u2019s unrelenting drive for public safety in the face of increased gun violence ultimately led to the development of a city-wide Community Safety Plan, a GTA-wide police task force on guns and gangs, an increase in the numbers of police officers in the street, and a young offender program that diverts young people into jobs instead of jail.\nMichael received his public school education in Scarborough and a BA in Economics from Concordia University in Montreal. Prior to entering politics, he earned his credentials as an entrepreneur in the business and financial services sector. In 2018, he successfully completed the Institute of Corporate Directors\u2019 ICD.D Directors Education Program presented by the Rotman School of Management.\nMichael is the recipient of the African Achievement Award for Excellence in Politics, the York University International Award, the Jain Society of Toronto Community Award, the Bob Marley Award and the Bob Marley Lifetime Achievement Award.\n(Information provided by the Councillor)\n",

He earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from York University, a certificate in Islamic Finance from Durham University (UK), a Post Graduate Certificate in International Shipping Finance from the Institute of Maritime and Economic Studies, Athens (Greece) and has pursued postgraduate studies in International Relations & Government at Harvard University.\nFor the last 15 years, he has proudly and honourably served his fellow residents of Scarborough-Agincourt in several capacities. Whether through his time as a Federal constituency assistant, a policy advisor to the Senate of Canada, or as Chief of Staff for the former Ward 22 Councillor, Nick has always had the best interests of our community as his focus. Amassing a great deal of knowledge and practical know-how, he has supported and advocated for our needs at all levels of government, in business, and through non-profit advocacy work. As someone who knows and understands the challenges, goals, and concerns of our community, Nick will continue to put Scarborough-Agincourt first.\n\u200bNick\u2019s dedication to community service is demonstrated by his participation in many cultural, business, and political organizations, including being elected Chair of the Panarcadian Federation of Canada and serving as a Director of the Hellenic Canadian Board of Trade (HCBT).\u00a0 Nick\u2019s honest approach and sincerity have earned him the respect of his colleagues and community as a whole.\nDeeply committed to humanity and democracy, Nick was able to be an elections observer in Libya just after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.\u00a0After this, he was invited to observe the elections in post-Chavez Venezuela. Nick\u2019s dedication and belief in the human spirit guided him through any perceived dangers that these environments may have posed. While most would fear for their lives, Nick saw this as an opportunity to make a difference to those who, on a daily basis, put their own lives in danger to have a taste of that which many of us take for granted. His passion and genuine nature was welcomed by the countless democracy-seekers he came across during his time in both countries.\nIn 2012, Nick was invited to the European Parliament in Brussels where he presented his thoughts on the cultural destruction in the occupied territory of Cyprus. Following this, he was a member of a delegation that presented a petition on the cultural destruction of occupied Cyprus to the Cultural Section at UNESCO.\nNick has effectively and respectably represented his community in all of his endeavors over the last many years, and continues to do so. He has kept close to his roots in Scarborough-Agincourt and his connection is sincere and unwavering. Nick will continue to serve you with dedication, passion, and humility as Councillor for Ward 22.\n(Information provided by the Councillor)\n",

    "bio": "\n\nOlivia Chow, 66th Mayor of Toronto\n\u00a0\n\nOlivia Chow is the 66th Mayor of Toronto, the first person of Asian descent to serve as Mayor, and the first woman since the six municipalities of Metro Toronto were amalgamated into one in 1998.\nBorn in Hong Kong in 1957, Mayor Olivia Chow immigrated to Toronto with her parents at the age of 13, where they moved to an apartment in the St. James Town neighbourhood. Her parents faced the challenges of so many immigrants who have come here to build a new life for their children and make an impact on our city. When Olivia\u2019s father failed to find work in his field and suffered a mental breakdown, her mother worked as a hotel maid to support the family. Through turbulent times at home, Olivia studied hard, graduated from Jarvis Collegiate and then studied Religion and Philosophy at the University of Toronto before studying fine art at OCAD and at the University of Guelph where she completed an Honours BA.\nAfter university, Olivia worked as a sculptor, ESL teacher and a counsellor for new immigrants. She was moved by the plight of the Vietnamese \u201cBoat People\u201d \u2013 refugees who had fled from their war-torn country in search of a better life in Canada. That was the starting point of a lifetime of activism and community organizing.\nPursuing her newfound passion for public service, Olivia was first elected as a TDSB trustee in 1985, where she served for six years. In 1991, Olivia became the first Asian-born woman elected as a Metro Toronto Councillor, where she created lasting programs that continue to help hundreds of thousands of families in Toronto each year. These include programs such as free dental care for children in poverty and the school breakfast and lunch program that helps kids focus on their teachers, not their hunger. She was re-elected to city council five times, serving with distinction for 14 years. While at City Hall, she served as Chair of the Community Services Committee and Vice Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) as well as served on the budget committee for a decade.\nWhile still a school trustee, Olivia married then City Councillor Jack Layton in 1988, and they forged one of Canada\u2019s most remarkable political partnerships. For over two decades, they worked together to achieve social justice in Toronto and then on the national stage where Jack served in Parliament as an MP, Leader of the NDP and ultimately Leader of the Official Opposition before his untimely death from cancer in 2011.\nIn 2006, Olivia was elected as the Member of Parliament for Trinity\u2014Spadina and was reelected twice, serving until 2014. While an opposition MP, she introduced an Early Learning and Child Care bill which laid the legislative foundation for a universal, high quality, affordable and non-profit national childcare program. Her bill on a National Public Transit Strategy was widely celebrated by mayors and municipalities from coast to coast.\nAfter leaving federal politics, Olivia wrote \u201cMy Journey\u201d, a book of memoirs chronicling her inspiring life story. In 2015, she joined Toronto Metropolitan University as a Distinguished Visiting Professor where her work focused on community engagement and leadership development. In 2016, she founded the Institute for Change Leaders, providing leadership training and community organizing skills that grass roots activists and organizers need to achieve social change, empowering thousands of people.\nAnd then in 2023, Olivia Chow opened a new chapter in her extraordinary life story when she ran for and won election as Mayor of Toronto, pledging to build a more affordable, safe and caring city where everyone belongs.\nThroughout her career, Olivia has been driven by the belief that we are always stronger together.\n\n",
